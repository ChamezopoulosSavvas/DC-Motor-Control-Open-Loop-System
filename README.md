# DC-Motor-Control-Open-Loop-System

This is a mini project developed for the ECE Auth course - Microprocessors and Peripherals

The developer team (Chamezopoulos Savvas, Mytilis Konstantinos) designed a system that controlls the speed of a given dc motor, while measuring the speed along with the dc-input of the motor in real-time. The microprocessor used was the Atmel mega16 on the stk500 test platform.

The system was the following:

Two implementations were created, an automatic and a manual one
